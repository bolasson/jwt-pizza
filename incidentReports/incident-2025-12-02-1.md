## Summary
Between the hours of 12:30 UTC and 14:10 UTC on 2025-12-02, 100% of users encountered failures when ordering JWT pizzas. The event was triggered by an external change in a third party API call. The change was made to chaos test this specific instance of JWT pizza. Bryce started working on the event by debugging the failing endpoint, and resolving the very obvious solution.
